# OpenCV Image and Video Matching
----------------------
This Python application utilizes OpenCV to perform image and video frame matching based on ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) keypoints. It is designed to load an image and a video file, detect keypoints, compute descriptors, and find and display matches in real-time.

## Features
----------------------
- **Image Loading**: Load any image in grayscale to prepare for keypoint detection.
- **ORB Detector**: Utilize ORB for efficient and robust keypoint detection and descriptor computation.
- **Brute Force Matcher**: Configure a matcher based on the Hamming distance with cross-check for accurate matching.
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Process video frames to find and display matches with reference image descriptors.
- **Visual Output**: View matching keypoints between the reference image and video frames in a real-time display window.

## Prerequisites
----------------------
Before running this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or newer is recommended. You also need to install OpenCV Python library.

## Installation
----------------------
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rasmusalbertsson/detect_details.git
   cd opencv-image-video-matching
Install dependencies:
----------------------
pip install numpy opencv-python

Usage:
----------------------
Run the Program
python main.py
Operation:
----------------------
The program will automatically load the specified reference image and video file. Press ESC to exit the video display window.
Customization
Changing Reference Image and Video:
You can change the Car_mask.jpg and cars_on_highway_1080p.mp4 paths in the main() function to any image or video path of your choice.
